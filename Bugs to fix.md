Bugs to fix:



* Custom FOOD ADD needs back button
* Register needs spaces for name(Optional, but recommended to fix) // THIS WONT WORK BECASUE WE HAVE AN OLDER VERSION OF A C++ COMPILER AND IT NEEDS STD::QUOTED INOREDR TO HAVE SPACE
* Food list requires "remove food"
* Enter age, weight, and height errors out when inputting letters // THIS IS FIXED 
*
